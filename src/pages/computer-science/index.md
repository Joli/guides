## Computer Science

Computer Science is the study of computers and the concepts that make computers possible. It involves both the theory behind the processes interacting inside of a computer, as well as how the hardware interacts with the overall system.

Much of computer science was pioneered in the latter half of the 20th century. It has rapidly advanced and revolutionized the way we use and view technology today.

Today, if you attend an undergraduate computer science course, you will learn about both hardware and software. You'll learn how computers work at a low level of abstraction (machine language) and at a high level of abstraction (modern scripting langauges like JavaScript).

In this section, we cover a lot of fundamentals of how contemporary computers work.
